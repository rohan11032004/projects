machine learning model for air quality index 
Real-time AQI Monitoring: Display current air quality levels based on user’s location. 
 Pollutant Tracking: Show individual pollutant concentrations like PM2.5, PM10, CO, 
NO₂, SO₂, and O₃. 
 Machine Learning-Based Prediction: Forecast AQI for upcoming hours/days using 
trained models. 
 Custom Alerts & Notifications: Notify users when AQI crosses health-critical thresholds. 
 Data Visualization: Display AQI trends through interactive graphs, charts, and maps. 
 User Profiles: Allow users to save locations, customize settings, and receive personalized 
content. 
 Community Reporting: Users can report visible pollution or local air quality changes. 
 Health Recommendations: Provide guidance and actions based on AQI levels (e.g., wear 
masks, avoid outdoor exercise)
